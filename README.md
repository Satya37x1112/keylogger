# Recently, I developed a basic keylogger in Python as part of my journey into ethical hacking and cybersecurity.
This project deepened my understanding of system-level programming, event listening, and data handling.
It also raised important questions about security, privacy, and responsible code usage.
I ensured all testing was done in a controlled, ethical environment for educational purposes only.
